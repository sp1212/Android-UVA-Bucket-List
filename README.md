# Android Bucket List App
## By scp4exq
This repo contains progress on the Android bucket list application for the first assignment for CS 4720.
The class starter template was used as a base layout through the class's GitHub organization.

Each card in the recycler view displays the title, due date, and a check box to indicate completion status.  
Incomplete items are displayed at the top of the list sorted by due date, while completed items are 
displayed at the top of the list sorted by date completed.  When an item is checked as completed, 
the completed date is set to the current date.  The date completed can only be set by checking the 
check box.  This was a design decision based on an open interpretation of the project requirements.

I enjoyed learning how granular mobile application development can be, similar to web development.  
I think that it is easy to underestimate the extent of coding and design work necessary to design an 
app without having done any app development yourself.  I have come to appreciate all of the thought 
that must go into especially mobile apps much more complicated than just a simple bucket list.  
I found myself able to apply a lot of different pieces of knowledge from past coding classes and 
other endeavors to integrate and connect various moving parts within this app.  Future mobile 
projects in other frameworks should now seem more natural given this basis of knowledge.
